# poseidon-framework/minotaur-recipes package request

Hello there!

Thanks for suggesting a new publication to add to the Poseidon Package Directory!
Please ensure you are completing all the TODOs outlined in these comments for each section.
-->
## Naming conventions

Please ensure that the package name you are requesting follows the naming conventions of the Poseidon archives.
Namely, the package should be named in the format:

```
<first author surname>_<year>_<short title>
```

We kindly ask that you do not use the journal name as the short title, but instead give some informative title that describes the content of the package.

## Check for existing package

I have checked the following places for the requested package and could not find
it:

- [ ] Poseidon Minotaur Archive
- [ ] The `packages/` directory in this repository
- [ ] Open issues in this repository
- [ ] Open pull requests in this repository

<!--
TODO: Please confirm that you checked the resources listed above to ensure that the requested package does not already exist under a different name than you expected.
-->

## Required information for the package

- DOI of publication: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07483-5 <- Please
  replace this example DOI with the one for the relevant publication
- Project accession number:
  [PRJEB29360](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB29360) <- Please replace
  this example ENA project link with the one for the relevant publication

<!--
TODO: Please replace the DOI and the study accession (and URL to the public sequencing data repository) above with the relevant information for the requested package
-->

## Will you work on this?

If you are planning to work on compiling the `.ssf` file required to add this
package, please assign yourself to this issue. This helps the community
collaborate effectively and avoid duplicating work.
